# Library Management System üìö

Welcome to the Library Management System project! This Java-based system offers a robust solution for managing library resources, members, and book transactions efficiently.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Add Books**: Easily add new books to the library catalog with details such as title, author, and ISBN.
- **Add Members**: Register new members with essential details like name and member ID.
- **Borrow and Return Books**: Enable members to borrow and return books seamlessly, keeping track of book availability and member transactions.
- **Search Books**: Allow users to search for books by title or author, facilitating quick access to desired resources.
- **Display Available Books**: Provide a comprehensive list of available books in the library, aiding users in selecting their next read.

## Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/harshalchavan7/Library-Management-System.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file to launch the Library Management System.

## Usage üñ•Ô∏è

- Navigate through the menu options to perform various tasks, including adding books, registering members, borrowing and returning books, and searching the catalog.
- Follow the prompts and instructions provided in the command-line interface to interact with the system effectively.

## Project Structure üìÅ

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the project, organized into packages for models and services.
- `target/`: Contains the compiled bytecode files (`.class`) generated after compiling the Java source code. This directory is typically created during the build process and is not included in version control. It's where the compiled files are stored before running the Java program.

## Dependencies üì¶

- Java JDK 8 or higher

## Future Scope üöÄ

1. **Database Integration**: Implement database integration to store library resources, member details, and transaction records, enabling data persistence and scalability.
2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a graphical user interface using JavaFX or Swing to provide a more user-friendly experience for library staff and members.
3. **Web Interface**: Create a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend framework like Spring Boot to allow users to access the library system from any web browser.
4. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the system and restrict certain actions based on user roles.
5. **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Enhance the search functionality with advanced filtering options, allowing users to search for books based on genre, publication year, and other criteria.
6. **Reporting and Analytics**: Integrate reporting and analytics features to generate insights into library usage, popular book titles, member demographics, and more.

## Example Usage

```java
// Example code snippet demonstrating how to add a book
LibraryService libraryService = new LibraryService();
Book book = new Book("9780743273565", "The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", 1925);
libraryService.addBook(book);
